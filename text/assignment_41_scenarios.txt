Problem 41-3

A)

You are driving a car for the first time.
You (wrongly) assume that the car can only go so fast, so you imagine a sigmoid as the gas pedal down % (x) to mph (y)
You go onto the freeway, and assume the capacity of the sigmoid is 65mph, so you hit the pedal to the metal.
Little do you know, instead of a 1999 used toyota corolla, you are actually driving a brand new 2020 Bugatti Chiron!
You accelerate into light speed, ripping the fabric of time open, creating a rift.
This immediatly creates a black hole and the entire world gets swallowed up.
If only you knew that the pedal down % to mph was linear...

B)

Imagine you are mining an astroid.
You have a droneship with only so much power, and you want to maximize the amount of platinum you extract from it.
You (wrongly) assume that the more you mine from the astroid, the more ore you will get from it.
While this is partly true, there is only so much ore on the astroid.
You begin mining, and base your completion on how much ore you have.
In reality, the ore plateaus off because there isn't much more ore in the astroid, but you keep mining to follow your prediction.
Eventually, you are barely getting any more ore, but you burnt through the majority of your battery.
Now, you can't retrieve your droneship from the astroid because it doesn't have enough power to fly!
You lose millions, possibly billions of dollars trying to mine the astroid but you end up losing your ship like someone who didn't take machine learning!
